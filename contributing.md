# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a
[Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this
project you agree to abide by its terms.

---

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Try to make your pull request as descriptive as possible, especially the title. "Update Readme.md" makes it harder for us to see directly what your pull request is about :)
- Keep descriptions short, simple and to the point.
- End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
- Titles should be [capitalized](http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/capitalization/rules-for-capitalization-in-titles.html).
- Please check your grammar and spelling as much as possible.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Please check that your contribution follows the following requirements :
  - The application has to follow enough of the GNOME HIG to work in a GNOME-based Desktop, by using an headerbar as the titlebar and looking clean in a vanilla GNOME desktop.
  - The application has to use GTK4 and LibAdwaita
  - Please avoid unmaintained items as they could break with time.
  - Please avoid items that haven't had any stable release, aren't mature or aren't mature yet.
  - If the item you propose is a Core GNOME Project, please label it as such.
  - If the item you propose is championned by the [GNOME Circle](https://www.gnome.org/Circle/) initiative, please also label it as such.
- If the item you want to add doesn't follow the requirements for being on this list, but will follow them in the future (in a future version for the HIG, for instance), please submit an issue for it.

Thank you for your suggestions!


## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/docs/blob/master/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
